 * This is the evolution of a simple derivative of Mendel/Huxley. * It was originally inspired by Vik's efforts and more recently Prusa Mendel. * Some more general discussion is found at RepRapBreeding * The core files for the my development of an Integrated Parametric RepRap in OpenSCAD are: * IPR_DNA: All constants and calculations, the constants define all the possible things that make a specific robot unique. (ranging from desired build space to fastener and bearing sizes) * IPR_func: All "standard" modules, such as motor mounts, bearing mounts, hardware models, etc... currently this file "builds" the main frame out of the hardware specified in the IPR_DNA file. * IPR_parts: All the actual part modules.   * *  By Nicholas C Lewis 2010 * *  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4784 *  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4960 *  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5048 *  http://reprap.org/wiki/Integrated_Parametric_RepRap * *  Loosly based on "mendel_misc.inc" by Vik Olliver 29-03-2010. * *  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify *  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by *  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or *  (at your option) any later version. * *  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, *  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of *  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
